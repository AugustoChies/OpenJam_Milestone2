Press right or left arrow keys for character to move. It will remember your imput but only move on the beat. Moving in the direction of an enemy while it is in front of you, kills it. An enemy damages you the same way, if it's next to you and you dont attack it or move away, you lose life. After losing life 3 times the player is destroyed.

There is no restart button, so you'll have to re-run the .exe.(Sorry :v)
